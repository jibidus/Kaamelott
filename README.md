Kaamelott App
=====================

A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports
using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

You need the ionic utility:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page.

## Installation

While we recommend using the `ionic` utility to create new Ionic projects, you can use this repo as a barebones starting point to your next Ionic app.

To use this project as is, first clone the repo from GitHub, then run:

```bash
$ cd ionic-app-base
$ sudo npm install -g cordova ionic gulp
$ npm install
$ gulp init
```

## Using Sass (optional)

This project makes it easy to use Sass (the SCSS syntax) in your projects. This enables you to override styles from Ionic, and benefit from
Sass's great features.

Just update the `./scss/ionic.app.scss` file, and run `gulp` or `gulp watch` to rebuild the CSS files for Ionic.

Note: if you choose to use the Sass method, make sure to remove the included `ionic.css` file in `index.html`, and then uncomment
the include to your `ionic.app.css` file which now contains all your Sass code and Ionic itself:

```html
<!-- IF using Sass (run gulp sass first), then remove the CSS include above
<link href="css/ionic.app.css" rel="stylesheet">
-->
```
